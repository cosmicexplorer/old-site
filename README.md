All the development occurs in the [site](/cosmicexplorer/cosmicexplorer.github.io/tree/site) branch, which is then built in the [site-built](/cosmicexplorer/cosmicexplorer.github.io/tree/site-built) branch because github pages is run in jekyll's safe mode, which doesn't allow custom build plugins, and then finally merged to [master](/cosmicexplorer/cosmicexplorer.github.io/tree/master), because github pages chokes on any type of submodules.
